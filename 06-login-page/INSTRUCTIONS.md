# Log in Form

You are given an empty React project as skeleton code.

Create a login form that asks the user for their user name and password. When the user clicks on the button, display whether the combination of user name and password is correct.

For now, assume that there is only one user. The user name is 'rotiprataguy' and the password is 'rotiprata123'.

## Your tasks

1. Create a component named `LoginForm`

2. Have two `<input type='text'>` in the component that allows user to enter their user name and password.

3. Have a `<button>Submit</button>` in the component, that when clicked, will check if the user has entered `rotiprataguy` for user name and `rotiprata123` for the password.

4. If the user did step 3 correctly, use the `alert` function to display "Login success", otherwise use the `alert` function to display "Invalid login"
