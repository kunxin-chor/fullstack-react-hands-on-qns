You will be tested on:

* using `state` variables and `setState`
* using event handlers

1. Create a new component named `Dice`. The component file has been created for you, but you have to add in the code yourself.

2. The `Dice` component should display a number in a box, with a button under it. You may use the css classes defined in `dice.css` if you like. The initial number displayed in the box is 1.

3. When the button is pressed, randomly generate a number between 1 to 6 and display it within the box.

4. Once it's working for one dice, create two more instances of the `Dice` component so that there are three `Dice` side by side.
