# Add & Update

__SKIP__ this question if you spent more than an hour on this. If you are stuck, it's an indicator that you need to revise earlier concepts.

Inside the `Library` component, you are given a state array with some books, and a form that isn't interactive. 

Your tasks are as below:

1. Add code to the `addBook` function such that it can read in data entered into the `New Book Form` and use that to create a new book. Add the new book to the state array

2. Add code to the `displayBooks` function such that it will return a JSX array of all the books. Display the title of the book, the ISBN, its genre and the tags that the book have.

3. Add code to the `displayEditBook` function such that it will allow the user to edit a book. Use back the same form that you used to create a new book. When editing a book, change the button to say `Update book` instead of `Add book`. 

4. Add code to the `updateBook` function that will process the update for a book.

5. Add code to the `cancelEditBook` function so that the user can cancel the editing of a book.


__IMPORTANT__

Add any functions or state variables as you deem fit to solve this solution.
